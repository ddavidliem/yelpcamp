# Yelpcamp

## Description:
This website is the culmination of my bootcamp experience, built using the MERN stack. It demonstrates my ability to develop a full-stack application incorporating MongoDB for database management, Express.js and Node.js for backend services. The project aims to showcase my skills in building a modern web application with real-time capabilities and responsive design.

## Tech Stack:
```
Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Back-End: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB, Mongo Atlas
```

## Explanation:
```
Front-End: Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive user interface.
Back-End: Employs Node.js and Express.js to handle server-side logic and API requests.
Database: Uses MongoDB for storing and managing data, with Mongo Atlas providing a cloud-based database service.
